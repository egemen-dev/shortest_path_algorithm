# Shortest Path Algorithm

Implementing BFS for the shortest path. 

I had practiced BFS algorithm with the [Binary Tree](https://github.com/egemen-github/binary_search_trees) and [Knight Travails](https://github.com/egemen-github/knights_travails) projects before. However, those graph projects were not involving weighted edges.

This project is all about weighted edges (e.g., vertices are not equally distanced, or cost of reaching the next node varies) which also means it's way more challenging. 

I am trying to come up with a solution right now.
